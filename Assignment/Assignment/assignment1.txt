Difference between initialize and instantiate 

Instantiation: Allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory. 'new' operator used
eg: new User();

Initialization: The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object.
eg: User u = new User();
 A variable u of type User is declared and new User object is instantiated, and  the variable u is initialized  with this object.
